## Day 1

I added three activities and created buttons to link the main activity to the two other activities.

![Main activity from day 1](screenshots/day-1-main-activity.jpg)
![Empty all tasks activity from day 1](screenshots/day-1-empty-all-tasks.jpg)
![Empty add task activity from day 1](screenshots/day-1-empty-add-tasks.jpg)

I added view components to the layouts of the activities and adjusted their positions using constraints. String values were added in the `strings.xml` file in the `res` directory. The `AndroidManifest.xml` file was updated to include the new activities created.
